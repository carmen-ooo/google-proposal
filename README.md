#Graphical browser for Bio4j model#
*GSC2014 Proposal*

Development of an interactive web-based tool that will allow users to intuitively explore the Bio4j domain model, getting details about both nodes/edges shaping the network as well as precise typing information in order to understand the Bio4j structure and manage/query it on an easier and more efficient way.


**Phase0. From 2nd week March â€“ 2nd week May**

- D3 self-learning period through on-line resources.
- Familiarization with Github platform and MarkDown tool.
- Collaboration on defining the GraphSON representation of the data model.
- For 21 April: Test representation of a small part of the domain model as first contact with the Bio4j platform and the GraphSON data on d3. Basic network representation with SVG objects using the force-directed [Force layout](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Force-Layout) implementation as simple first exploration.

Carry one exploring **d3 force layout basics**.

I am basically compiling, understanding an editing multiple d3 force layout codes from [http://bl.ocks.org](http://bl.ocks.org/)

 


###Update 06/04/2014###

First d3 force layout tests.

I  don't understand how **GraphSON format** data works, so I made a simple **JSON file** (Bio4j1.json) of a fragment of the Bio4j domain model nodes, links and properties to start playing with by looking at its structure here:  *GitHub\bio4j\src\main\java\com\bio4j\model\ ...*
